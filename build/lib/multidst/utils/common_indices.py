    """
    Determine common indices among multiple lists of significant p-values.

    Args:
    - p_values (list): A list of p-values.
    - sig_bonf_p (list): A list of indices of p-values significant after Bonferroni correction.
    - sig_holm_p (list): A list of indices of p-values significant after Holm-Bonferroni correction.
    - sig_sgof_p (list): A list of indices of p-values significant after SGoF test.
    - sig_bh_p (list): A list of indices of p-values significant after Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
    - sig_by_p (list): A list of indices of p-values significant after Benjamini-Yekutieli method.
    - sig_q (list): A list of indices of p-values significant after Storeyâ€™s Q value method.

    Returns:
    - l0_list (list): Indices not present in any of the significant lists.
    - l1_list (list): Indices present in exactly one significant list.
    - l2_list (list): Indices present in exactly two significant lists.
    - l3_list (list): Indices present in exactly three significant lists.
    - l4_list (list): Indices present in exactly four significant lists.
    - l5_list (list): Indices present in exactly five significant lists.
    - l6_list (list): Indices present in all six significant lists.
    - index_dict (dict): Dictionary containing lists of indices grouped by their presence in significant lists.

    This function takes in lists of significant p-values for various methods of hypothesis testing and
    determines the common indices among them. It categorizes the indices based on their occurrence in
    different numbers of significant lists, from 0 to 6. It also returns a dictionary containing lists
    of indices grouped by their presence in significant lists.
